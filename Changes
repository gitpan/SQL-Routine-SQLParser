                       SQL-Routine-SQLParser
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.2.2 (SVN r878).

    * New code file versions are: SQLParser.pm 0.2.2 and en.pm 0.2.2.

    * From now on, any ordinary 'use [|only ]Foo' statements that appear
    within *.pm files will be located in different places than before; the
    'use' statements for modules that do not export anything, particularly
    object oriented modules, will appear near the top of the file, above
    all package declarations, but just below the use-pragma statements; the
    'use' statements for modules whose exported functions we are using will
    be placed just below the declarations of each package in which the
    relevant exported functions are used.

    * Removed any line-trailing whitespace from all distribution files.

    * Reformatted all code by swapping various string quoting delimiters.

    * Updated SQLParser.pm and t_SRT_SP_Util.pm to replace all of their
    'unless' conditionals with equivalent 'if' conditionals.

    * Updated SQLParser.pm to rename all of its 'foreach' loops to 'for'.

    * Reformatted all code to change any "if( ... ) {" to "if (...) {".

    * Added named constant $EMPTY_STR to SQLParser.pm.

    * Reformatted all code so that any uses of the named unary operators
    [defined|ref] no longer have parenthesis around their argument.

    * Updated SQLParser.pm to replace 1 "<condition> and return ...;" with
    "return ... if <condition>;".

    * Updated t_SRT_SP_Util.pm to replace 1 "if ... return ..." with its
    postfix-if equivalent.

    * Updated SQLParser.pm to rearrange 3 conditional '_throw...' statements
    so they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Reformatted all code, in SQLParser.pm, so that any uses of the
    built-in operators or functions named [bless|join] no longer have
    parenthesis around their argument lists; either the parens were just
    removed, or they were moved to surround both the operator/function name
    and its arguments.

    * Split up some long lines in en.pm.

    * Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to reformat any indented
    sections as paragraphs, and show version ranges like 'only' takes them.

    * Reformatted all code so that every occurance of the string
    concatenation operator (.) has a space between the operator and each of
    its 2 arguments, rather than their all being in contact.  Also
    reformatted any lines that are split on this operator so the operator
    appears at the start of the second line, rather than the end of the
    first line.

    * Other miscellaneous code line alignments and splitting.

    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.2.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: SQLParser.pm 0.2.1 and en.pm 0.2.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.01 thru 0.2.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.2.0 (SVN r787), containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLParser 0.2.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the first
    release of this distribution and its modules for which they had 3-part
    version numbers, rather than floating point version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.01, containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLParser 0.01, was released on CPAN; this is the first
    release of the SQL-Routine-SQLParser distribution.  This is the first
    release of any distribution to contain SQL::Routine::SQLParser.  This
    is the first release of any distribution for which some of the existing
    work that became the SQL-Routine-SQLParser distribution was in the form
    of executable code, and not just design documentation.  This is the
    only release of this distribution and its modules for which they had
    floating point version numbers, rather than 3-part version numbers.
