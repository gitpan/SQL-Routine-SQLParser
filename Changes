    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.2.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: SQLParser.pm 0.2.1 and en.pm 0.2.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.01 thru 0.2.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.2.0 (SVN r787), containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLParser 0.2.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the first
    release of this distribution and its modules for which they had 3-part
    version numbers, rather than floating point version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

    * SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.01, containing
    SQL::Routine::SQLParser 0.01, was released on CPAN; this is the first
    release of the SQL-Routine-SQLParser distribution.  This is the first
    release of any distribution to contain SQL::Routine::SQLParser.  This
    is the first release of any distribution for which some of the existing
    work that became the SQL-Routine-SQLParser distribution was in the form
    of executable code, and not just design documentation.  This is the
    only release of this distribution and its modules for which they had
    floating point version numbers, rather than 3-part version numbers.
