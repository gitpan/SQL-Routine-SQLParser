	* SQL-Routine-SQLParser Release 0.01.

	* This release is a place-holder for other distributions to refer to; it
	contains a framework into which I can put code that does something useful
	later; for now it declares a functionally empty object.

	* Original code file versions are: SQLParser.pm v0.01 and en.pm v0.01.

	* Original external dependencies are on Locale::KeyedText v1.05 and on
	SQL::Routine v0.65.

	* This is the first release of any distribution to contain
	SQL::Routine::SQLParser.  This is the first release of any distribution for
	which some of the existing work that became the SQL-Routine-SQLParser
	distribution was in the form of executable code, and not just design
	documentation.

	* For historical posterity, this is this distribution's file manifest:
