TODO

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best
practices.  This includes having code lines not be longer than 75
characters (like the POD lines).  This and other changes will be
accomplished by running all the code files through perltidy (the first time
I ever use that program, though I was a very consistent formatter before),
which may alter a few other things towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release
#4.

* Add some actual functionality to SQLParser.pm.  When this happens, also
add an external dependency on something like Parse::RecDescent which will
help implement said functionality.

* Update the Changes file to summarize events prior to 2005-06-25, where
the module existed soley as references in Rosetta::Framework and other
places.  Then update the copyright statement so its first year coincides
with the first mention; for now it is the same date as
SQL::Routine::SQLParser, which is probably wrong.

* Make the test suite test more than that the module compiles.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are
needed. See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and
"Rosetta-Emulator-DBI" distributions for a clue as they are the initial
main dependents of the SQL::Routine::SQLParser module.
