TODO

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best practices.
This includes having code lines (and POD lines, presumably) not be longer than
80 or 78 characters.  Also run the works through perltidy for the first time as
well (though I was very consistent before), which may alter a few other things
towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release #3.

* Add some actual functionality to SQLParser.pm.  When this happens, also add an
external dependency on something like Parse::RecDescent which will help
implement said functionality.

* Update the Changes file to summarize events prior to 2005-06-25, where the 
module existed soley as references in Rosetta::Framework and other places.  Then 
update the copyright statement so its first year coincides with the first mention; 
for now it is the same date as SQL::Routine::SQLParser, which is probably wrong.

* Make the test suite test more than that the module compiles.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are needed. 
See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and "Rosetta-Emulator-DBI"
distributions for a clue as they are the initial main dependents of the
SQL::Routine::SQLParser module.
