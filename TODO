* Add some actual functionality to SQLParser.pm.  When this happens, also add an
external dependency on something like Parse::RecDescent which will help
implement said functionality.

* Update the Changes file to summarize events prior to 2005-06-25, where the 
module existed soley as references in Rosetta::Framework and other places.  Then 
update the copyright statement so its first year coincides with the first mention; 
for now it is the same date as SQL::Routine::SQLParser, which is probably wrong.

* Make the test suite test more than that the module compiles.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are needed. 
See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and "Rosetta-Emulator-DBI"
distributions for a clue as they are the initial main dependents of the
SQL::Routine::SQLParser module.
