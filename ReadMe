PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "SQL::Routine::SQLParser";
see the file lib/SQL/Routine/SQLParser.pm for the main documentation, which is
in POD format.  The distribution also includes a ChangeLog file to say what
changes already happened, and a TODO file to say what changes have yet to
happen.  The file INSTALL should help with installation issues.  Read below for
how to get support or keep up to date, know this distribution's dependencies, or
read the credits or copyright and license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.008001

Core Modules:

	Test::More 0.47 (but only for the test suite)

Non-Core Modules: 

	Locale::KeyedText 1.05 (for error messages)
	SQL::Routine 0.65

This module doesn't require anything else.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

CREDITS

None besides myself so far.

produce the combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GPL plus
this exception.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on SQL::Routine::SQLParser, and which is fully useable when not linked to
SQL::Routine::SQLParser in any form.

Any versions of SQL::Routine::SQLParser that you modify and distribute must
carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any

modified version of SQL::Routine::SQLParser that you are willing to distribute,
because that is a practical way of suggesting improvements to the standard
version.
